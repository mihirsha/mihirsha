# üë®‚Äçüíªüõ† Hi, I‚Äôm Mihir ‚Äî Building ML infrastructure and wrangling models

I‚Äôm an engineer, wrangling **ML models** and building **ML infrastructure** for a living. Professionally, I have experience in **MLOps** and a growing focus on becoming an **Applied Scientist**. With 2+ years of industry experience, I‚Äôve built **scalable data platforms** and **production-ready ML workflows**, specializing in designing end-to-end pipelines, optimizing cloud infrastructure, and deploying intelligent automation across distributed systems.

Currently, I‚Äôm pursuing my **MSc in Applied Computing** at the **University of Toronto**, where I‚Äôm expanding my expertise as an **Applied Researcher**.

Previously, as a **Software Engineer II at Nielsen**, I worked on **MLOps initiatives** where I developed large-scale data pipelines in **Scala/Spark**, automated **CI/CD workflows** with **GitHub Actions**, and orchestrated **ML training and inference pipelines** using **Apache Airflow**. I also implemented **data quality monitoring frameworks** to ensure reproducibility and stability across production systems. Beyond Nielsen, I contributed to projects where I deployed **ML workloads on Kubernetes (AWS EKS)** for autoscaling and high availability, used **MLflow** for experiment tracking and model versioning to streamline the transition from research to production, and built **Dockerized ML services** that exposed **REST APIs** for both real-time inference and batch scoring.
